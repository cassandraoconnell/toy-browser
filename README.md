Nothing too exciting to see hereâ€”just the start of implementing [Matt Brubeck's toy browser engine](https://limpet.net/mbrubeck/2014/08/08/toy-layout-engine-1.html) in Javascript. This is mainly just for my own education to learn more about how browsers actually work. Maybe one day I'll finish it.
